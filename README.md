# Snake!
This program is based off the original snake arcade game. It consists of 3 elements, the menu page, game, and the game over page.

When the player dies, the game preforms an upward sweep animation before showing the game over page.

As the score increases, the snakes gains movement speed exponentially. When passing a certain score, the background will change themes.

Run the game.py script to play the game!
